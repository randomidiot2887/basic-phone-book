# Basic phonebook.
>> yes it sounds just as boring as the name is.

Yes, this is my new fangled *project*. a phonebook. 
This is written in python, and ive already writen too much functions already
The main **shit** is in /source/main.py.
the stuff about displaying which i just implememted as of __14/9/2025__ is in /source/displaydrv.py

> This is still work in progress, its nowhere near done
> IDK if it even runs yet, oponly the last function in displaydrv ive tested, which works

## Test.py
### if you wanna see some random snippets, go to **/source/test.py**
### The snippet in it usually changes between commits so itll be intresting.
### rn as of writing, it has a snippt for keyboard inputs *linux only*

## DISCLAIMER
> I just finished IGCSE and am working on my coding skills.
> My code may not be perfect, but im learning.
> for example, the function *search()* in __/source/main.py__ is the worst algorithm ive written
> ill improve it later on, but i need ot get this *shit* atleast running before doing that.


btw, `backticks are really cool`
